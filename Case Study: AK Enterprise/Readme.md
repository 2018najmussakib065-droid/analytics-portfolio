#Python • NumPy • Data Cleaning • Visualization • EDA#

This project is based on a structured assignment analyzing sales data of AK Enterprise, a mid-sized electronics and home appliances company. The goal of the project was to practice Python fundamentals, NumPy operations, data cleaning, reshaping, and visualization techniques using real-world-style messy data.

*The notebook includes solutions to 15+ analytical and data engineering tasks, covering everything from loops and functions to advanced data cleaning and visualizations.*

##Project Overview##

###1. Python Fundamentals###

Calculated total revenue using loops

Wrote condition-based functions to check sales target achievement

Created a function to compute average customer rating for a product

###2. NumPy & Matrix Operations###

Created a 2D matrix representing regional sales

Transposed the matrix & calculated column-wise totals

Normalized the entire matrix to values between 0 and 1

###3. Data Cleaning & Reshaping###

Performed complete cleaning on the raw dataset:

Identified and imputed missing values (mean & mode)

Replaced invalid entries (e.g., 999999 → median)

Cleaned incorrect strings (e.g., AK-AK)

Converted column types for proper computation

Removed outliers in profit columns

Reshaped dataset using melt()

Engineered a NetProfit feature considering discount deductions

###4. Data Visualization###

Created meaningful plots to extract insights:

 **Bar Chart:** Total sales per product

 **Scatter Plot:** ComputerSales vs ComputerProfit

 **Line Chart:** Monthly trends

 **Pie Chart:** Customer segment distribution

 **Boxplot:** Profit distribution across regions

 **Histogram:** Customer ratings distribution

###5. Tech Stack & Libraries###

**Python**

**Pandas**

**NumPy**

**Matplotlib / Seaborn**

**Jupyter Notebook**
