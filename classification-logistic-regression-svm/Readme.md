# Logistic Regression & Support Vector Machine – Classification Practice

This repository contains hands-on practice and conceptual exploration of **classification algorithms**, focusing on **Logistic Regression** and **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** using Python.

The goal of this project is to build a **strong foundation in supervised machine learning classification**, combining theoretical understanding with practical implementation.

---

## Models Implemented
- **Logistic Regression**
  - Multiclass classification
  - Applied on the Iris dataset
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
  - Linear and RBF kernels
  - Applied on the Raisin dataset (binary classification)

---

## Datasets Used
- **Iris Dataset**
  - Classic multiclass classification dataset
- **Raisin Dataset**
  - Binary classification problem
  - Source: *UCI Machine Learning Repository*

---

## Workflow
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Train–test split
- Model training and prediction
- Model evaluation using:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-score
  - Confusion Matrix
- Visualization using:
  - Scatter plots
  - Heatmaps

---

## Key Results
- Logistic Regression achieved **high accuracy (~97%)** on the Iris dataset
- Linear SVM performed better than RBF kernel on the Raisin dataset
- Clear understanding gained on:
  - Decision boundaries
  - Margins and support vectors
  - Effect of kernel choice and hyperparameters (`C`, `gamma`)

---

## Key Learning Outmes
- Difference between binary and multiclass classification
- How SVM finds optimal separating hyperplanes
- Role of kernels in non-linear classification
- Practical interpretation of evaluation metrics
- Importance of feature scaling in SVM

---

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

---

## Notes
This project is part of my learning journey in **Machine Learning and Data Science** and focuses on building solid conceptual clarity along with implementation skills.
